I'm Boris and this is my blog.

I am a Software Engineer at Anthropic, where I created [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code). Before that I was at Instagram, where I prototyped and scaled the next big ideas for product & infra. A few years ago I wrote a book: [O'Reilly's Programming TypeScript](https://amazon.com/Programming-TypeScript-Making-JavaScript-Applications/dp/1492037656). I live in San Francisco. In my free time you can find me reading, running, and salting things.

Find me on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@boris_cherny), [X](https://x.com/bcherny), [Github](https://github.com/bcherny), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcherny), or get in touch at boris at this domain dot com.
