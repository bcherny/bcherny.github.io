I'm Boris and this is my blog. I wish I added to it more often.

About me: I'm an engineer and product manager at Meta, where I serve as the tech lead for [Facebook Groups](https://facebook.com/groups). A few years ago I wrote a book: [O'Reilly's Programming TypeScript](https://smile.amazon.com/Programming-TypeScript-Making-JavaScript-Applications/dp/1492037656). In my free time -- when I'm not reading, writing, running, or fermenting things -- I run the [San Francisco TypeScript Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-TypeScript-Meetup/).

Find me on [Github](https://github.com/bcherny) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcherny).
