I'm Boris and this is my blog.

About me: I'm an engineer at Instagram, where I prototype and scale the next big ideas for product & infra. A few years ago I wrote a book: [O'Reilly's Programming TypeScript](https://amazon.com/Programming-TypeScript-Making-JavaScript-Applications/dp/1492037656). I live in Nara, Japan. In my free time I read, run, and salt things.
