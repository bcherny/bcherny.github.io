I'm Boris and this is my blog.

I am a Software Engineer at Instagram, where I prototype and scale the next big ideas for product & infra. A few years ago I wrote a book: [O'Reilly's Programming TypeScript](https://amazon.com/Programming-TypeScript-Making-JavaScript-Applications/dp/1492037656). I live in Nara, Japan. In my free time you can find me reading, running, and salting things.

Find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/b.cherny/), [Github](https://github.com/bcherny), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcherny), or get in touch at boris at this domain dot com.
