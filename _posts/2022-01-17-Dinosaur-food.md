title: 'Dinosaur Food: the oldest plants we still eat today'
categories: Food
---

I just finished Oliver Sacks' excellent _[Everything in Its Place](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/538576/everything-in-its-place-by-oliver-sacks/)_. In it, he mentioned as an aside that the _Ginkgo biloba_ tree is hundreds of millions of years old, and its phenotype has been practically frozen since then -- a living fossil.

Of course, this is the same tree that grows ぎんなん (Ginkgo nuts), an East Asian delicacy found in many dishes, 茶碗蒸し (Chawanmushi) for example.

Ginkgo has been around so long, it predates the dinosaurs! And we still eat it! How cool is that. This got me thinking -- what are the oldest plants we consume today?

Criteria:

1. Must be edible, and have a record of having been used for food
2. Must be morphologically unchanged since its fossil age
