title: 'Time and Timing'

You often hear that "timing matters". It helps to think about this as two related concepts: time and timing.

For some things, time is more important than timing:

- **Investing (long term)**. Investing for the long term is [all about](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/barry-ritholtz-time-not-timing-is-key-to-investing-success/2014/08/21/b3443d9a-27d2-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html) holding a diverse set of assets for as long as possible. It doesn't matter if you invest at discounted price, because (a) most of your gains come from the long-term effects of compounding, not from the price you bought at, and (b) you'll probably time it wrong anyway.
- **Learning**. It's never too late to learn a new skill or expertise. But the earlier you start, the more you will be rewarded with better opportunities, improved decision making, and [higher job satisfaction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you). Like an investment, your knowledge will compound to improve all the choices you make and things you do throughout life.
- **Relationships**. Building your social network will give you access to opportunities and friends/partners you wouldn't have had otherwise. The longer you do this, the more you'll benefit yourself and others.

For other things, timing is more important than time:

- **Investing (short term)**. I once sold my three best Pokemon cards on eBay for $0.99 plus shipping; today, those cards would have fetched at least 100x that. Short-term investing is about timing the market to sell at a peak, buy at a trough, or exploit an inefficiency before everyone else catches on.
- **Starting a business**. Many good business ideas failed because they were tried at the wrong time -- either the market wasn't ready for them, or the tech wasn't ready. Successful businesses don't just have a great idea and execute it well, but they need to do it at just the right time.
- **Genes**. For a mutated gene to take off in a population, it has to give its carriers a reproductive advantage in the environment at the time. A drought resistance gene isn't useful in a year with heavy rain.

What's the difference between these two classes of phenomena? Things that compound are all about *time*; the longer you do them, the faster the benefits build on each other. Things that are about exploiting a new opportunity are about *timing*; if you don't do them at the right time, you won't be rewarded. Try not to confuse the two.
