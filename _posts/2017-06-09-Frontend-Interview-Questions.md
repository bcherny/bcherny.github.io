title: The Best Frontend JavaScript Interview Questions (written by a Frontend Engineer)
date: 2017-06-09
categories: JavaScript "Functional Programming"
---

I was at a [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Free-Code-Camp-SF/) in San Francisco a few days ago (for those not familiar, Free Code Camp is a group of people who get together to learn JavaScript and web development), and someone getting ready for frontend dev job interviews asked for JavaScript questions to practice. After a bit of Googling, I couldn't find any lists I could point her to and say "if you can do these, you can land a job". [Some](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) [came](https://github.com/khan4019/front-end-Interview-Questions) [pretty](https://github.com/kennymkchan/interview-questions-in-javascript) [close](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/3-questions-to-watch-out-for-in-a-javascript-interview-725012834ccb), [some](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95) [were](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions) [silly](https://www.codementor.io/nihantanu/21-essential-javascript-tech-interview-practice-questions-answers-du107p62z), but all were either incomplete or asked questions that people don't actually ask in real life.

So, based on my experiences on both sides of the interview table, here goes. These are a sampling of questions I've asked and been asked when hiring frontend engineers. Keep in mind that some places (like Google) focus more on designing efficient algorithms, so if you want to work there you should practice [past CodeJam problems](https://code.google.com/codejam/past-contests) in addition to the stuff below. If you have a question that belongs in one of these lists (or I've made a mistake somewhere), [shoot me an email](mailto:boris@performancejs.com).

I'll be adding/updating answers to these questions [here](https://github.com/bcherny/frontend-interview-questions) (feel free to make PRs with additions/improvements!).

I've grouped questions into a few sections: **Concepts**, **Coding**, **Debugging**, and **System Design**:

## Concepts

Be able to clearly explain these in words (no coding):

1. What is Big O notation, and why is it useful?
2. What is the DOM?
3. What is the event loop?
4. What is a closure?
5. How does prototypal inheritance work, and how is it different from classical inheritance? (this is not a useful question IMO, but a lot of people like to ask it)
6. How does `this` work?
7. What is event bubbling and how does it work? (this is also a bad question IMO, but a lot of people like to ask it too)
8. Describe a few ways to communicate between a server and a client. Describe how a few network protocols work at a high level (IP, TCP, HTTP/S/2, UDP, RTC, DNS, etc.)
9. What is REST, and why do people use it?
10. My website is slow. Walk me through diagnosing and fixing it. What are some performance optimizations people use, and when should they be used?
11. What frameworks have you used? What are the pros and cons of each? Why do people use frameworks? What kinds of problems do frameworks solve?

## Coding

Implement the following functions (tests follow each question):

### Easy

1. `isPrime` - Returns `true` or `false`, indicating whether the given number is prime.

   ```js
   isPrime(0) // false
   isPrime(1) // false
   isPrime(17) // true
   isPrime(10000000000000) // false
   ```

2. `factorial` - Returns a number that is the factorial of the given number.

   ```js
   factorial(0) // 1
   factorial(1) // 1
   factorial(6) // 720
   ```

3. `fib` - Returns the nth [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

   ```js
   fib(0) // 0
   fib(1) // 1
   fib(10) // 55
   fib(20) // 6765
   ```

4. `isSorted` - Returns `true` or `false`, indicating whether the given array of numbers is sorted.

   ```js
   isSorted([]) // true
   isSorted([-Infinity, -5, 0, 3, 9]) // true
   isSorted([3, 9, -3, 10]) // false
   ```

5. `filter` - Implement the [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Filter) function.

   ```js
   filter([1, 2, 3, 4], (n) => n < 3) // [1, 2]
   ```

6. `reduce` - Implement the [`reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) function.

   ```js
   reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], (a, b) => a + b, 0) // 10
   ```

7. `reverse` - Reverses the given string (yes, using the built in [`reverse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse) function is cheating).

   ```js
   reverse('') // ''
   reverse('abcdef') // 'fedcba'
   ```

8. `indexOf` - Implement the [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) function for arrays.

   ```js
   indexOf([1, 2, 3], 1) // 0
   indexOf([1, 2, 3], 4) // -1
   ```

9. `isPalindrome` - Return `true` or `false` indicating whether the given string is a plaindrone (case and space insensitive).

   ```js
   isPalindrome('') // true
   isPalindrome('abcdcba') // true
   isPalindrome('abcd') // false
   isPalindrome('A man a plan a canal Panama') // true
   ```

10. `missing` - Takes an unsorted array of unique numbers (ie. no repeats) from 1 through some number _n_, and returns the missing number in the sequence (there are either no missing numbers, or exactly one missing number). Can you do it in _O(N)_ time? Hint: There's a clever formula you can use.

    ```js
    missing([]) // undefined
    missing([1, 4, 3]) // 2
    missing([2, 3, 4]) // 1
    missing([5, 1, 4, 2]) // 3
    missing([1, 2, 3, 4]) // undefined
    ```

11. `isBalanced` - Takes a string and returns `true` or `false` indicating whether its curly braces are balanced.

    ```js
    isBalanced('}{') // false
    isBalanced('\\{\\{}') // false
    isBalanced('{}{}') // true
    isBalanced('foo { bar { baz } boo }') // true
    isBalanced('foo { bar { baz }') // false
    isBalanced('foo { bar } }') // false
    ```

### Intermediate

1. `fib2` - Like the `fib` function you implemented above, able to handle numbers up to `50` (hint: look up memoization).

   ```js
   fib2(0) // 0
   fib2(1) // 1
   fib2(10) // 55
   fib2(50) // 12586269025
   ```

2. `isBalanced2` - Like the `isBalanced` function you implemented above, but supports 3 types of braces: curly `{}`, square `[]`, and round `()`. A string with interleaving braces should return false.

   ```js
   isBalanced2('(foo { bar (baz) [boo] })') // true
   isBalanced2('foo { bar { baz }') // false
   isBalanced2('foo { (bar [baz] } )') // false
   ```

3. `uniq` - Takes an array of numbers, and returns the unique numbers. Can you do it in _O(N)_ time?

   ```js
   uniq([]) // []
   uniq([1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 8]) // [1, 4, 2, 3, 8]
   ```

4. `intersection` - Find the intersection of two arrays. Can you do it in _O(M+N)_ time (where _M_ and _N_ are the lengths of the two arrays)?

   ```js
   intersection([1, 5, 4, 2], [8, 91, 4, 1, 3]) // [4, 1]
   intersection([1, 5, 4, 2], [7, 12]) // []
   ```

5. `sort` - Implement the [sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) function to sort an array of numbers in _O(NÃ—log(N))_ time.

   ```js
   sort([]) // []
   sort([-4, 1, Infinity, 3, 3, 0]) // [-4, 0, 1, 3, 3, Infinity]
   ```

6. `includes` - Return `true` or `false` indicating whether the given number appears in the given _sorted_ array. Can you do it in _O(log(N))_ time?

   ```js
   includes([1, 3, 8, 10], 8) // true
   includes([1, 3, 8, 8, 15], 15) // true
   includes([1, 3, 8, 10, 15], 9) // false
   ```

7. `assignDeep` - Like [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign), but merges objects deeply. For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that objects can contain only numbers and other objects (and not arrays, functions, etc.).

   ```js
   assignDeep({a: 1}, {}) // { a: 1 }
   assignDeep({a: 1}, {a: 2}) // { a: 2 }
   assignDeep({a: 1}, {a: {b: 2}}) // { a: { b: 2 } }
   assignDeep({a: {b: {c: 1}}}, {a: {b: {d: 2}}, e: 3})
   // { a: { b: { c: 1, d: 2 }}, e: 3 }
   ```

8. `reduceAsync` - Like the [`reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) you implemented in the Easy section, but each item must be resolved before continuing onto the next.

   ```js
   let a = () => Promise.resolve('a')
   let b = () => Promise.resolve('b')
   let c = () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('c'), 100))
   await reduceAsync([a, b, c], (acc, value) => [...acc, value], [])
   // ['a', 'b', 'c']
   await reduceAsync([a, c, b], (acc, value) => [...acc, value], ['d'])
   // ['d', 'a', 'c', 'b']
   ```

9. Implement `seq` in terms of `reduceAsync`. `seq` takes an array of functions that return promises, and resolves them one after the other.

   ```js
   let a = () => Promise.resolve('a')
   let b = () => Promise.resolve('b')
   let c = () => Promise.resolve('c')
   await seq([a, b, c]) // ['a', 'b', 'c']
   await seq([a, c, b]) // ['a', 'c', 'b']
   ```

### Harder

_Note: For the data structures you'll implement below, the idea isn't to memorize them, but just to be able to look at the given API, Google how they work, and implement them, and to have a high level idea of what they are used for and what their tradeoffs are compared to other data structures._

1. `permute` - Return an array of strings, containing every permutation of the given string.

   ```js
   permute('') // []
   permute('abc') // ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']
   ```

2. `debounce` - Implement the [debounce](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#debounce) function.

   ```js
   let a = () => console.log('foo')
   let b = debounce(a, 100)
   b()
   b()
   b() // only this call should invoke a()
   ```

3. Implement a [`LinkedList`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) class without using JavaScript's built-in arrays (`[]`). Your LinkedList should support just 2 methods: `add` and `has`:

   ```js
   class LinkedList {...}
   let list = new LinkedList(1, 2, 3)
   list.add(4)                           // undefined
   list.add(5)                           // undefined
   list.has(1)                           // true
   list.has(4)                           // true
   list.has(6)                           // false
   ```

4. Implement a [`HashMap`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) class without using JavaScript's built-in objects (`{}`) or `Map`s. You are provided a `hash()` function that takes a string and returns a number (the numbers are mostly unique, _but sometimes two different strings will return the same number_):

   ```js
   function hash(string) {
     return string
       .split('')
       .reduce((a, b) => (a << 5) + a + b.charCodeAt(0), 5381)
   }
   ```

   Your HashMap should support just 2 methods, `get`, `set`:

   ```js
   let map = new HashMap()
   map.set('abc', 123) // undefined
   map.set('foo', 'bar') // undefined
   map.set('foo', 'baz') // undefined
   map.get('abc') // 123
   map.get('foo') // 'baz'
   map.get('def') // undefined
   ```

5. Implement a [`BinarySearchTree`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) class. It should support 4 methods: `add`, `has`, `remove`, and `size`:

   ```js
   let tree = new BinarySearchTree()
   tree.add(1, 2, 3, 4)
   tree.add(5)
   tree.has(2) // true
   tree.has(5) // true
   tree.remove(3) // undefined
   tree.size() // 4
   ```

6. Implement a [`BinaryTree`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) class with breadth first search and inorder, preorder, and postorder depth first search functions.

   ```js
   let tree = new BinaryTree()
   let fn = (value) => console.log(value)
   tree.add(1, 2, 3, 4)
   tree.bfs(fn) // undefined
   tree.inorder(fn) // undefined
   tree.preorder(fn) // undefined
   tree.postorder(fn) // undefined
   ```

## Debugging

For each of the following questions, start by understanding and explaining why the given piece of code doesn't work. Then propose a couple of fixes, and rewrite the code to implement one of the fixes you proposed so the program works correctly:

1. I want this code to log out `"hey amy"`, but it logs out `"hey arnold"` - why?

   ```js
   function greet(person) {
     if (person == {name: 'amy'}) {
       return 'hey amy'
     } else {
       return 'hey arnold'
     }
   }
   greet({name: 'amy'})
   ```

2. I want this code to log out the numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` in that order, but it doesn't do what I expect (this is a bug you run into once in a while, and some people love to ask about it in interviews).

   ```js
   for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
     setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0)
   }
   ```

3. I want this code to log out `"doggo"`, but it logs out `undefined`!

   ```js
   let dog = {
     name: 'doggo',
     sayName() {
       console.log(this.name)
     },
   }
   let sayName = dog.sayName
   sayName()
   ```

4. I want my dog to `bark()`, but instead I get an error. Why?

   ```js
   function Dog(name) {
     this.name = name
   }
   Dog.bark = function () {
     console.log(this.name + ' says woof')
   }
   let fido = new Dog('fido')
   fido.bark()
   ```

5. Why does this code return the results that it does?

   ```js
   function isBig(thing) {
     if (thing == 0 || thing == 1 || thing == 2) {
       return false
     }
     return true
   }
   isBig(1) // false
   isBig([2]) // false
   isBig([3]) // true
   ```

## System design

If you're not sure what "system design" means, [start here](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).

1. Talk me through a full stack implemention of an autocomplete widget. A user can type text into it, and get back results from a server.

   - How would you design a frontend to support the following features:
     - Fetch data from a backend API
     - Render results as a tree (items can have parents/children - it's not just a flat list)
     - Support for checkbox, radio button, icon, and regular list items - items come in many forms
   - What does the component's API look like?
   - What does the backend API look like?
   - What perf considerations are there for complete-as-you-type behavior? Are there any edge cases (for example, if the user types fast and the network is slow)?
   - How would you design the network stack and backend in support of fast performance: how do your client/server communicate? How is your data stored on the backend? How do these approaches scale to lots of data and lots of clients?

2. Talk me through a full stack Twitter implementation (shamelessly stolen from my friend [Michael Vu](https://github.com/blaisebaileyfinnegan)).
   - How do you fetch and render tweets?
   - How do you update tweets as new ones come in? How do you know when new ones came in?
   - How do you search tweets? How do you search by author? Talk me through your database, backend, and API designs.
