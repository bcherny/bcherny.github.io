Last month, Anthropic released Claude Code, an experimental tool for agentic coding. As the original author of Claude Code, I wanted to share a few tips for more effectively using Code. These tips are based on my experience, and on watching many dozens of professional engineers use Code.

Claude Code is intentionally low level, giving you as close to raw model access as possible. It does not force you to use specific workflows, instead opting to be a power tool that is flexible, customizable, scriptable, and safe. Claude Code works the way you want to work. This flexibility, while powerful, can be a challenge for engineers that have not worked with agentic coding tools before, at least until they've discovered their own best practices for how they want to use Code and what to use it for.

In this post, I'll lay out some of the general patterns I've seen work well, both for engineers and researchers using Code at Anthropic, and for engineers using Code for all sorts of codebases, languages, and environments outside of Anthropic. Nothing in this list is set in stone; use it as a starting point, and crucially, experiment and find what works for you!

# 1. Tune your environment

## a. Write a CLAUDE.md

## b. Invest in tuning your CLAUDE.md

## c. Curate your allowed tools list

# 2. Common workflows

## a. Write tests, commit, code, commit

## b. Codebase Q&A

## c. Git Q&A
